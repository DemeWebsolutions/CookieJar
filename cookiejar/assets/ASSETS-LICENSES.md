# CookieJar Assets Licensing

All bundled images, SVGs, and icons within the `assets/` directory are original works by DemeWebsolutions.com (My Deme, LLC) and are released under GPLv2 (or later) to be compatible with WordPress.org requirements.

- No remote CDN assets are loaded by the plugin.
- Google Analytics script is only enqueued when a site owner explicitly enters an ID; this is an optional integration.

If you add third-party assets in future versions, include their licenses here and ensure they are GPL-compatible.
